The shuttle had several entry points including a front ramp, a rear ramp, and doors to the side. The interior of the ship had a main passenger section and a cockpit. In the passenger/cargo area, there were benches and harnesses on each side with a ladder to the side of the front ramp leading directly to a hatch for cockpit access.

In 4.3 ABY, Supreme Commander Ennix Devian of the Kaarenth Dissension used this false Death Star to create a diversion at the temporary Alliance of Free Planets capital of Endor while his forces stealthily hijacked countless warships from neighboring Alliance shipyards. While the Kaarenth Dissension's sophisticated feint was a successful distraction, this so-called Death Star III was ultimately destroyed by Red Squadron when Red Leader made a direct hit to its unprotected thermal exhaust port. The exact measurements and capabilities of the station are not completely known, except that it was armed with a superlaser similar to the other stations in the series and had a relatively heavier defense network of turbolasers dotting the surface. The station was never completed and at the time of its destruction, scaffolding was still present in the trench leading to its weak spot, creating obstacles for would-be attackers. Nonetheless, the station had been nearing finalization, evidenced by its looking more whole compared to the Death Star II. Despite it being created either during or after the Death Star II, which had removed various design flaws that doomed the first Death Star, it still shared the same design flaw as the first Death Star: a thermal exhaust port located within one of the trenches",

    txt: "he Millennium Falcon, originally designated YT 492727ZED and formerly known as the Stellar Envoy, was a Corellian YT-1300f light freighter most famously used by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca, during and following the Galactic Civil War. During the Falcon's time in the possession of the smuggler Lando Calrissian, it accumulated numerous modifications in the name of convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large escape pod. However, during Han Solo's infamous record-breaking Kessel Run, in which he piloted the freighter for the first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered by the time Solo won it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of sabacc. Its aged appearance still belied numerous advanced modifications to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and shields, including a hyperdrive engine among the fastest in the entire galaxy, enabling it to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. It also included sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the rescue of Princess Leia Organa in 0 BBY to evade Imperial stormtroopers. Afterwards, the Millennium Falcon saw further action when Solo chose to join the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Yavin, where it was able to sneak up and fire on Darth Vader's TIE Advanced, allowing Luke Skywalker to fire the proton torpedo that destroyed the Death Star. After Solo was captured on Bespin, Calrissian took command of the Falcon once more to search for him. In 4 ABY, following Solo's rescue, Calrissian flew the ship at the Battle of Endor, where it entered the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station and aided in its destruction from within. Over the next decades, the ship fell out of Solo's hands and was stolen by a succession of criminals and thieves, ending up in the ownership of the trader Unkar Plutt on Jakku, a remote world in the Western Reaches. The Falcon was eventually stolen by the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey, former First Order stormtrooper Finn, and Resistance droid BB-8 to escape the forces of the First Order in 34 ABY. Shortly thereafter, it was reunited with Solo and Chewbacca. Following Solo's death soon after, the Millennium Falcon became a Resistance vessel piloted by its new owner, Rey, throughout much of the First Order/Resistance War. In 35 ABY, the ship was once again captained by Calrissian during the Battle of Exegol, which saw a decisive victory for the Resistance and Jedi Order, before being returned to Rey, who had been newly dubbed a Skywalker.",

Its front section contained a large flight deck and hangars to accommodate a complement of Republic starfighters and gunships. The Republic deployed the Venator-class Star Destroyers across the galaxy during the conflict with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Often utilized as flagships by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Venator-class was closely associated with the Jedi Order as a result. Venators served in several major engagements of the Clone Wars, including the Battle of Christophsis, the Battle of Sullust, and the Battle of Coruscant. Following Order 66 and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Venator-class Star Destroyers remained in service to the Imperial Navy during the early days of the Imperial Era. Ultimately, though, the Venator-class was decommissioned and replaced by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, a larger warship that was modeled on its Republic predecessor.",
